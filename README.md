# Methods of Synthesis of Virtual Reality (VR)

This project was developed as part of the university curriculum for the "Methods of Synthesis of Virtual Reality" course. It demonstrates advanced real-time rendering techniques using WebGL, specifically focused on anaglyphic stereo imaging and computer vision integration.

## Key Features

* **Anaglyphic Stereo Rendering:** Generates a 3D stereo effect (Red-Cyan) for 3D models.
* **Dual-Layer Visualization:** Renders the model in wireframe mode overlaid on top of filled polygons.
* **Negative Parallax:** Specifically configured to create an "out-of-screen" 3D effect.
* **Camera Integration:** Renders a real-time video stream from your web camera at the zero-parallax plane (as a background).
* **Interactive Controls:** Full mouse-based rotation of the model around its center of mass.

##  Configurable Parameters

The application provides a GUI or control interface to dynamically adjust:
* **Eye Separation:** Adjust the distance between virtual eyes to control depth intensity.
* **Field of View (FoV):** Change the viewing angle of the virtual camera.
* **Near Clipping Distance:** Define the closest point visible to the camera.
* **Convergence Distance:** Set the distance at which the left and right images overlap perfectly (zero parallax).
